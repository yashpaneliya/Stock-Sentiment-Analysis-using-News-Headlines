# Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines
Predicting stock market prices has been a topic of interest among both analysts and researchers for a long time. Stock prices are hard to predict because of their high volatile nature which depends on diverse political and economic factors, change of leadership, investor sentiment, and many other factors. Predicting stock prices based on either historical data or textual information alone has proven to be insufficient. 

Existing studies in sentiment analysis have found that there is a strong correlation between the movement of stock prices and the publication of news articles. Several sentiment analysis studies have been attempted at various levels using algorithms.
